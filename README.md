# Project Details

This repo is the fourth project in Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program.
The project is focused on deploying the build tool Webpack as part of a single page web app.

The app uses the MeaningCloud (https://www.meaningcloud.com/) API for sentiment analysis. Users can enter a URL to an article on the web. 
The app will return details on the sentiment found across the article.

The project uses Jest for unit tests and Service Workers for offline functionality.
